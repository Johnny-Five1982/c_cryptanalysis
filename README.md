c_cryptanalysis
===============

This is a collection of classical cryptanalysis programs writen in C.

This is currently a dump of all the programs I have written, it needs some sorting out. The programs are mixed up pretty good.

Todo:
-----

. write a make file with different targets for each program
. speed optimise each of the programs
